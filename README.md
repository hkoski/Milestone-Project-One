# Milestone-Project-One
Interactive Web Game using HTML/CSS/JavaScript

Idea #1: Typing game with a racing theme. The faster you type, the faster the car goes. For every mistyped word(3 letter errors) a bug splatters your windshield. The car naturally avoids collision, but as the windshield fills up, you will crash and lose. Timed game with a leader scoreboard; keeps personal time records. 
*MVP: Functioning web browser game that has random text pop up and receives user input, have an accurate word counter and timer, has graphics of: car, road, bugs.
*Stretch goals: More active animations, words/sentences get harder with passing "levels", add in boosters that add time or forigves errors (does not alter WPM but provides user a chance to average WPM over multiple minutes), leaderboard and list of PRs.

Idea#2: Racing game (running or driving) using the arrow keys and spacebar. There are obstacles to avoid and boosts to pick up. Game ends with either too many hit obstacles or reaching the finish line. Leader scoreboard that records times.
