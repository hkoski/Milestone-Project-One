# Milestone-Project-One
Interactive Web Game using HTML/CSS/JavaScript

Idea #1: Typing game with a racing theme. The faster you type, the faster the car goes. For every mistyped word(3 letter errors) a bug splatters your windshield. The car naturally avoids collision, but as the windshield fills up, you will crash and lose. Timed game with a leader scoreboard; keeps personal time records. 

Idea#2: Racing game (running or driving) using the arrow keys and spacebar. There are obstacles to avoid and boosts to pick up. Game ends with either too many hit obstacles or reaching the finish line. Leader scoreboard that records times.
